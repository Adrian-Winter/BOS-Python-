# BOS-Python
## A simple script that can visualize airflows! ðŸ’¨ 

## What is BOS?
This little tool letÂ´s you visualize currents by using the Background-oriented-schlieren-Technique or short BOS. BOS utilizes the phenomenon that if a local gas current is present, a local in densitygradient can be found as well. Mediums with different desities distort light in a diffrently, therefore a pixelshift can be detected where a change in density is present. Notice that the change in density can have multiple causes such as a change in temperature and does not solely represent the flow of a gas.
